## What is Cloud?

You can imagine your computer or phone. It stores all your pictures, files, and apps, right? But what if you run out of space or lose your device? That where cloud comes in. The cloud is like a giant digital storage space, but it's not just one big hard drive sitting somewhere. It's actually made up of lots of powerful computers connected over the internet. 

## What is AWS Cloud?

There are many cloud providers like Azure, Google Cloud Platform, IBM cloud etc, each offering range of services for businesses and individuals.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the leading cloud providers in the market, providing comprehensive suite of cloud computing services. It offers a vast array of computing resources, including servers, storage,databases, networking, and more, all delivered over the internet. It's like a huge digital world where companies and people can use really strong computers without having to invest in physical hardware.

## Importance of AWS Cloud?

The AWS Cloud is important because it lets businesses and individuals do things that were once only possible for big companies with lots of funds.
